13/02/22, 10:37 pm - +91 96274 24678: He is a good case study of why some people are menace to society

13/02/22, 10:40 pm - +91 90210 64912: i just reseted the link bcoz of spam
13/02/22, 10:40 pm - +91 88020 51134: He is still spamming in main group😂
13/02/22, 10:40 pm - +91 98920 05293: Also members of the group should b mature enough to keep posts on-topic
13/02/22, 10:41 pm - +91 98920 05293: Its a good thing u have done....loss for those who didnt join earlier
13/02/22, 10:41 pm - +91 96274 24678: True. Adding to it, if stupid talks are allowed in group, mature people will simply leave and then instead of being a support group it will become another typical watsapp joke group
13/02/22, 10:41 pm - +91 88952 15095: The one who is admin please remove them who post unnecessary things
13/02/22, 10:42 pm - +91 98920 05293: Right.... Also most groups become political.... Right wing vs left wing...
13/02/22, 10:46 pm - +91 96274 24678: Not sure if that's a good idea. Only one person was spamming, who was blocked. I think link should be available to all, so that those who are remaining can join.
13/02/22, 10:47 pm - +91 98920 05293: I have quit the old group...otherwise i would have pasted new link in that group...
13/02/22, 10:47 pm - +91 90210 64912: There is remove option but no block option in group

Take user input, giving the user options to press the respective key for the operation.

Use if command to check which key is pressed by user and call the corresponding function

15/02/22, 5:16 pm - +91 96274 24678: Subclasses can have their own _init_

15/02/22, 5:21 pm - +91 92050 40564: Sorry... I believe this is very confusing.. package is a folder and inside the package folder, there are two python files called __init__.py and module.py.

15/02/22, 5:25 pm - +91 96274 24678: Oh gotcha. I am not aware of it, so will stay away from commenting. But I would guess _init_ file must work as _init_ method in some way. Someone else mIght be able to clarify


From Google -"The __init__.py file lets the Python interpreter know that a directory contains code for a Python module. An __init__.py file can be blank. ... The file essentially the constructor of your package or directory without it being called such. It sets up how packages or functions will be imported into your other files"

15/02/22, 11:47 pm - +91 88020 51134: 😂😂😂😂
Bro thats not a important topic
As sir said python will take 1year to master itself
15/02/22, 11:48 pm - +91 80831 70499: Okay i try
15/02/22, 11:48 pm - +91 98920 05293: yes... lots of topics we will have to self-learn
15/02/22, 11:49 pm - +91 95456 96219: that's the reality
15/02/22, 11:49 pm - +91 99401 35765: https://realpython.com/regex-python/
15/02/22, 11:50 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
15/02/22, 11:51 pm - +91 88020 51134: I would suggest not to focus on these side topics
Better spend time on logic building and OOPS
15/02/22, 11:52 pm - +91 98920 05293: yes... n very soon they will teach us algorithms.... thats a heavy topic in itself
15/02/22, 11:52 pm - +91 99401 35765: https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html
15/02/22, 11:54 pm - +91 92050 40564: I think sudhanshu will cover regex while teaching NLP. There are massive use of regex in NLP
15/02/22, 11:54 pm - +91 98920 05293: even the first FSDS batch has not reached NLP even after one year of starting😀
15/02/22, 11:55 pm - +91 88020 51134: How do you know that
15/02/22, 11:55 pm - +91 98920 05293: i have a friend in that batch... they suffered lots of delays due to covid...
15/02/22, 11:56 pm - +91 88020 51134: He got placed?
15/02/22, 11:56 pm - +91 92050 40564: 😥😥😥😥
15/02/22, 11:56 pm - +91 98920 05293: no...
15/02/22, 11:56 pm - +91 98920 05293: for getting placed massive efforts r needed....
15/02/22, 11:57 pm - +91 92050 40564: this is scary .. I assume that they are covering all topic within promised timeframe
15/02/22, 11:58 pm - +91 88020 51134: I think for him 
The internship style was different 
Ineuron used to club us into team and give internship projects
15/02/22, 11:59 pm - +91 98920 05293: Sudhanshu is not worried about timeframe... he wants to do every topic proper justice....
15/02/22, 11:59 pm - +91 98920 05293: i think the first batch doesnt even have their whatsapp group
15/02/22, 11:59 pm - +91 90210 64912: Does sudhanshu is teaching all topics
16/02/22, 12:01 am - +91 98920 05293: sudhanshu for ML & python, Krish for stats, Avnish for projects, a lady for chatbot, Sunny Bhaveen Singh for DL & mostly Sourangshu Paul for CV & NLP....
16/02/22, 12:02 am - +91 88020 51134: Fastrack khtm kar diya kya bhai?
16/02/22, 12:02 am - +91 88020 51134: 😅
16/02/22, 12:02 am - +91 98920 05293: as i said... i know someone from first batch! he tells me everything
16/02/22, 12:03 am - +91 92050 40564: Thanks for sharing this... are other faculty teaching well?
16/02/22, 12:03 am - +91 92050 40564: excpet krish and sudhanshu
16/02/22, 12:03 am - +91 98920 05293: there was one guy called Vikash who came for deployment in various platforms...
16/02/22, 12:04 am - +91 98920 05293: yes... everyone is top class
16/02/22, 12:05 am - +91 98920 05293: i think their passion for teaching is the best i have seen in all these years of school, college, coaching classes, private tuitions etc
16/02/22, 12:05 am - +91 92050 40564: ahhh.. then we are in between of good team
16/02/22, 12:05 am - +91 98920 05293: yes... the only problem is soon the level of difficulty will increase so much that we will barely have enough time to absorb all concepts
16/02/22, 12:06 am - +91 92050 40564: totally agree with you
16/02/22, 12:06 am - +91 98920 05293: what we r learning right now is just a, b, c
16/02/22, 12:06 am - +91 90210 64912: Completing project alone is dangerous for health 
Group can help us a lot
For this batch also they will make groups
16/02/22, 12:07 am - +91 98920 05293: i dont think so.... people in first FSDS r doing projects independently i think..
16/02/22, 12:09 am - +91 90210 64912: Those who completes project they have to post on LinkedIn i have seen almost all projects were in group
16/02/22, 12:09 am - +91 98920 05293: ok.. pls share the link here too if u see in future..
16/02/22, 12:12 am - +91 98920 05293: u r right.. i just confirmed with my friend.... Sudhanshu gave liberty of creating groups for projects..
16/02/22, 12:13 am - +91 98920 05293: but the right of selecting group members lies with an individual.... 😀
16/02/22, 12:13 am - +91 90210 64912: Yes
16/02/22, 12:14 am - +91 98920 05293: i think all strong guys like mukesh, chandan & ganesh will select each other 😀
16/02/22, 12:15 am - +91 90210 64912: 😂
16/02/22, 12:15 am - +91 92050 40564: thanks for your kind word.. but i believe in sabka saath sabka vikash😂😂
16/02/22, 12:15 am - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
16/02/22, 12:16 am - +91 90210 64912: That's the reason i will join with you
16/02/22, 12:17 am - +91 86228 22661: Everybody has started internship??
16/02/22, 12:18 am - +91 92050 40564: I think we all discuss project in whatsapp group
16/02/22, 12:18 am - +91 98920 05293: yaha assignments mein lagi padi hai.... internships is next level shit
16/02/22, 12:18 am - +91 90210 64912: I am going for data analyst project starting next month

16/02/22, 12:28 am - +91 90210 64912: there are 900+ college affiliated With them i don't think they are toughest but they keep pattern upto date only
16/02/22, 12:52 am - +91 96274 24678: I think we can host a spreadsheet for this group, where people can list what projects they are interested in and then those with similar interests can make a group
16/02/22, 12:53 am - +91 88020 51134: You just made a team thanks 😂😂😂
16/02/22, 12:53 am - +91 96274 24678: What do you mean?

17/02/22, 1:33 pm - +91 93102 71488: But why we used bracket in walrus operator?
17/02/22, 1:39 pm - +91 89240 44957 joined using this group's invite link
17/02/22, 1:45 pm - +91 88952 15095: What is this walrus operator?
17/02/22, 1:47 pm - +91 92050 40564: This is type of assignment operator.In walrus operator we give instruction to interpretor to assign the value to variable which is not existing yet.() is a way to tell interperter forcefully that the code inside the () run first then rest of code execute.According to me this is the main reason behind () but you could confirm this from sudhanshu or sunny.
17/02/22, 1:48 pm - +91 89240 44957: Has anyone started internship here ?
17/02/22, 1:48 pm - +91 80831 70499: No

17/02/22, 1:49 pm - +91 93102 71488: yeah that's the reason of using parenthesis
17/02/22, 1:50 pm - +91 88020 51134: Like?
17/02/22, 1:50 pm - +91 80831 70499: I think first of all we need to complete our course after that it will be better.
17/02/22, 1:51 pm - +91 89240 44957: Like if we create same application as mentioned in previously uploaded videos will they approve or not?

18/02/22, 3:16 pm - +91 92050 40564: Use ide .. this is only way to handle indentation issue.. you may need to keep eyes on color of the character. For e.g if there is indentation issue in code the that lines change to red

19/02/22, 2:00 pm - +91 93541 96288: I think Insertion here means inserting the CSV file into mongodb and fetching the data🤔
19/02/22, 2:01 pm - +91 92050 40564: No .. updating records are different.. for updating the record there should be data exists in collection

I have more than 2 year of experience as a production engineer.
 In the month of sep-2021, I have resigned due to workload in the job. So right now,
I am preparing for data analyst since sep-2021. I have finished MSSQL, STATISTICS from udemy. I have also finished Google data analytics professional certificate. 
In the month of October,  I come to know ineuron. So, I joined ineuron,  finish all statistics in fast track mode.
I have given relevel test also and the best score in first round I have got is 148.
So, anyone in the group who are serious, you can text me personally.I want to learn together.  With the help of ineuron and other resources also

This can done by using type casting?
23/02/22, 2:25 pm - +91 88952 15095: Yeah
23/02/22, 2:48 pm - +91 75493 09226: Hi everyone,
I need some help...
Currently I am working in a company where I am having bond of two years( which will end in dec 2022). I was not happy with my work and gave few interviews. Finally selected in one. But I haven't informed new company HR about my previous company bond. Will there be any problem after joining new company ?? Need your input in this..
23/02/22, 2:49 pm - +91 77670 76332: Have u informed your current company that u r leaving the organisation???
23/02/22, 2:50 pm - +91 75493 09226: Yes
23/02/22, 2:50 pm - +91 90210 64912: U can break bond they will never take u to court 😂
If u want experience certificate then u have to complete 2 years
23/02/22, 2:50 pm - +91 80086 91168: Will they provide docs if you leave the company without serving 2 yers.
23/02/22, 2:50 pm - +91 77670 76332: What they said? Do u have to pay the bond money??
23/02/22, 2:51 pm - +91 75493 09226: Yes..they are saying that I have to pay full amount..
23/02/22, 2:51 pm - +91 77670 76332: Bro, plzzz don't mis guide...
Do u gave any such experience?
23/02/22, 2:51 pm - +91 89218 66691: Which company are you working in and which company did you get now
23/02/22, 2:51 pm - +91 77670 76332: *have
23/02/22, 2:52 pm - +91 89218 66691: If you want you can break bond no issues you just have to pay money
23/02/22, 2:52 pm - +91 89218 66691: U won't get any certificate that you worked there.. that's all
23/02/22, 2:52 pm - +91 75493 09226: I need experience certificate because I have told my new company that I have 1.2 years of experience and based on that they proceed with my application
23/02/22, 2:52 pm - +91 77670 76332: U can discuss this with the new organisation, and u can negotiate with the HR to pay the bond money
23/02/22, 2:52 pm - +91 90210 64912: My friend was on wipro wilp he was having 5 years bond he just leaved company in 1 year everyday they use to msg him for money but now they stopped
23/02/22, 2:53 pm - +91 80086 91168: Negotiate with your new company HR if they can pay the amount which your old  company expecting
23/02/22, 2:53 pm - +91 77670 76332: This is not the right way
23/02/22, 2:53 pm - +91 88020 51134: You can ask your company to pay for the bond and you will join their company asap 
And as insurance you can create a bond with then also
If new company is really interested in you then they will surly do it
23/02/22, 2:54 pm - +91 80086 91168: It will not be the case in all scenarios
23/02/22, 2:54 pm - +91 75493 09226: They are not ready to pay...I am ready to pay the amount, but i have only one doubt that I have not my new company HR about bond...what if they get to know about this in background verification process
23/02/22, 2:54 pm - +91 90210 64912: And there is no such law which gives permission to lock employee 
Company will never take u too court they will just fear u with words
23/02/22, 2:55 pm - +91 80086 91168: That's fine if you are paying their won't be a problem if thoug they get to know
23/02/22, 2:55 pm - +91 89218 66691: Well you should have told them about this.. there is no point in hiding things from HR
23/02/22, 2:55 pm - +91 88517 76922: They might ask for a penalty fee
23/02/22, 2:55 pm - +91 77670 76332: If u pay the bond money, and if they are ready to give u the 1.2yrs experience certificate, then i don't think any issue will happen....
23/02/22, 2:56 pm - +91 75493 09226: Thanks guys!!
23/02/22, 2:57 pm - +91 80086 91168: But if you are joining early in new org you can ask of early joining perks
23/02/22, 2:57 pm - +91 75493 09226: I am serving my NP too
23/02/22, 2:57 pm - +91 88517 76922: I would suggest first settle it down with your old company, get the experience certificate and then add it to your profile in the new company.
23/02/22, 3:00 pm - +91 90210 64912: Bonds are legal but claiming money for breaking it is illegal practice
23/02/22, 3:01 pm - +91 92050 40564: Try to complete 2 year bond.. this is little difficult for you but this is easiest way
23/02/22, 3:01 pm - +91 98490 24355: Yes
23/02/22, 3:02 pm - +91 92050 40564: Generally company doesn't invest to much on such type of legal activities. Although they have also maintained repo in market but sometimes this create problem
23/02/22, 3:06 pm - +91 90210 64912: To solve this problems u need a lawyer 
Last year my brother didn't got his experience certificate from LTI bcoz of bond break my brother  sued LTI next day they called and said we will give ur certificate and 20000 rs plz take back case 
Company also known that their bonds are illegal
23/02/22, 3:10 pm - +91 77670 76332: सुनकर अच्छा लगा... 😂
23/02/22, 3:13 pm - +91 70006 50240: Ask Sudhanshu
23/02/22, 3:15 pm - +91 75493 09226: This is true , but i can break the bond without giving them any money, but in return I will not get any experience letter...I need experience letter because without this , new company will not proceed with my application..
23/02/22, 3:17 pm - +91 90210 64912: Do u have bond copy is there anything written there about fine u can't take Certificates
23/02/22, 3:18 pm - +91 90210 64912: Most of the company never mention about fine they just fear us
23/02/22, 3:18 pm - +91 75493 09226: Amount was mentioned in bond letter...
23/02/22, 3:19 pm - +91 90210 64912: What is amount
23/02/22, 3:19 pm - +91 75493 09226: 2 lakhs..

23/02/22, 3:20 pm - +91 75493 09226: Bond amount is huge..
23/02/22, 3:21 pm - +91 90210 64912: The amount which is known as fine is nothing but amount which is spended on your training 
I don't think they have given 2lakh rs training u can easily win case
23/02/22, 3:21 pm - +91 95456 96219: <Media omitted>
23/02/22, 3:23 pm - +91 77670 76332: Bro, I would like to tell you one thing...
For some companies bond money depends on the time you spent in company...
For eg. If you spent less than 6 months you have to pay the full bond money, 
greater than 6 months n less than 1 year you have to te half of the bond money and 
if you spend greater than 1 years and less thann 2 yrs bond money is 25%
23/02/22, 3:23 pm - +91 77670 76332: Like that
23/02/22, 3:23 pm - +91 77670 76332: Please check in your case
23/02/22, 3:28 pm - +91 70458 55965: Okay

23/02/22, 5:04 pm - +91 96412 66982: I think you should inform the new company HR about bond n if there is any buyback option then that would help to break the bond
23/02/22, 5:15 pm - +91 86228 22661: Sorry it was q3

24/02/22, 11:06 am - +91 86228 22661: Doing all possible way but not able to print, is it because of system issue?
24/02/22, 11:07 am - +91 99120 85300: dude, start with a smaller object
24/02/22, 11:07 am - +91 99120 85300: upto 20 or 50 items, debug the logic
24/02/22, 11:08 am - +91 86228 22661: I got the logic and it's working fine for smaller items but not working for all data
24/02/22, 11:09 am - +91 99120 85300: could be system issue (unable to process huge volume), or code needs optimization
24/02/22, 11:10 am - +91 86228 22661: Are you able to print all data or just printing small items
24/02/22, 11:11 am - +91 99120 85300: I was able to print all data

26/02/22, 11:33 am - +91 93102 71488: Yes
26/02/22, 11:33 am - +91 88020 51134: Very
26/02/22, 11:33 am - +91 93102 71488: Very important
26/02/22, 11:33 am - +91 74105 56589: but companies not using flask they use django mostly
26/02/22, 11:33 am - +91 70210 01964: Have sir thought numpy

We need to understand the flow of code so flask is needed I think
26/02/22, 11:36 am - +91 74105 56589: is any one completed course till ml

28/02/22, 3:47 pm - +91 96274 24678: Has anyone compiled the list of all the tasks given in our batch so far?
28/02/22, 4:20 pm - +91 74105 56589: a = dataset.copy()  

a = dataset 


which is the exapmle of deep copy and shallow copy  

*dataset is dataframe in pandas
28/02/22, 4:27 pm - +91 81498 25749: I guess both are shallow copy.....
28/02/22, 4:27 pm - +91 88020 51134: 1 - deep
2 _ shallow
28/02/22, 4:30 pm - +91 81498 25749: If .copy() func gives deep copy
28/02/22, 4:30 pm - +91 81498 25749: Then whats the use of copy.deepcopy() func???
28/02/22, 4:30 pm - +91 74105 56589: this is correct by experience on dataset
28/02/22, 4:32 pm - +91 74105 56589: I think this is after importing copy modulee
28/02/22, 4:33 pm - +91 88020 51134: I have this confusion too
Lets ask in revision class
28/02/22, 4:33 pm - +91 81498 25749: Sure...

28/02/22, 4:57 pm - +91 70380 84811: Ok thanx
28/02/22, 5:12 pm - +91 99120 85300: Both are different,  copy is shallow copy,  it won't copy nested inner json objects
28/02/22, 5:13 pm - +91 81498 25749: Yes, that is what I read from internet...
28/02/22, 7:56 pm - +91 70210 01964: When was the logging taught

02/03/22, 1:37 pm - +91 88952 15095: Yeah you can or you can call the parent class there
02/03/22, 1:42 pm - +91 99401 35765: if u want to access i, u can call super().__init__() in child __init__ method
02/03/22, 1:45 pm - +91 75659 77166: Can u please change 4th index only a
02/03/22, 1:45 pm - +91 88952 15095: Yeah super method too
02/03/22, 1:46 pm - +91 88952 15095: Or person._init_() also you can use
02/03/22, 1:46 pm - +91 88952 15095: Person._init_()
02/03/22, 1:46 pm - +91 75659 77166: Only 4th index which is a rest a should not be change

02/03/22, 5:09 pm - +91 99817 19305: basically you are taking each character with the help of for loop and then adding it in the reverse order to a new string.
02/03/22, 5:19 pm - +91 89509 15724: But it should take it as 
A
A
Y
.

For loop works like that but in this case it is not following this please tell me about that part

04/03/22, 10:22 pm - +91 98920 05293: I follow sudh's advice seriously....first learn to sit on chair...
04/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 77670 76332: Remember 1 thing,

Number of hours on chair is directly proportional to money you get in hands
04/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 77670 76332: Exactly 💯
04/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 96274 24678: Ok so which chair? Asking for recommendation
04/03/22, 10:23 pm - +91 77670 76332: This quote is by Sudhanshu Sir

04/03/22, 10:24 pm - +91 96274 24678: Okay, I can work on it with laptop but if I want to use two screens, I would need proper chair
04/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 90210 64912: Yes
04/03/22, 10:25 pm - +91 98920 05293: Also work on desk....

04/03/22, 10:26 pm - +91 96274 24678: Desk isn't an issue tbh, as long as it has flat surface to keep stuff
04/03/22, 10:26 pm - +91 96274 24678: Good chair is important imo for long hours sitting
04/03/22, 10:27 pm - +91 90210 64912: I use to keep blanket on my old chair

04/03/22, 10:35 pm - +91 95737 56565: Guys
Plz dnt sit on bed n work if u dnt have table and comfortable chair ....Try to sit on ground n move ur bumbs every 15 minutes left to right n vice versa .....
04/03/22, 10:36 pm - +91 96274 24678: How is sitting on ground better than bed?
04/03/22, 10:39 pm - +91 95737 56565: Bed,
It is sponge and not constant. And if u continuously sit then it will effect ur spinal cord later on u will face problems with spiral issues dislocating ur bones n also have neck issues because ur neck wil be constant looking to laptop....
04/03/22, 10:41 pm - +91 95737 56565: Sitting on ground but changing ur positions with ground level support under our bumbs will exercise the spinal cord as well and also ur neck positions
04/03/22, 10:42 pm - +91 95737 56565: It's kind of exercise infront of laptop if u work for long hours
04/03/22, 10:43 pm - +91 95737 56565: If u have comfortable chair then it's OK.....with big table keeping ur laptop or monitor on it
04/03/22, 10:44 pm - +91 99877 34340: 😂😂😂😂
04/03/22, 10:44 pm - +91 99877 34340: Same here
04/03/22, 10:45 pm - +91 98920 05293: Yeah i find sitting on hard surfaces extremely uncomfortable for long durations
04/03/22, 10:45 pm - +91 98920 05293: 😆

08/03/22, 9:52 pm - +91 77670 76332: But
08/03/22, 9:52 pm - +91 77670 76332: Its true
08/03/22, 9:53 pm - +91 95157 41868: In the course they said 500+ hours. Assuming it is 600 hours, per month 24 hrs.

08/03/22, 10:02 pm - +91 98920 05293: By that time DS may go out of fashion
08/03/22, 10:10 pm - +91 77779 90769: Everyone has Fast track options guys , why are you worried
08/03/22, 10:10 pm - +91 95456 96219: <Media omitted>

08/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 77779 90769: For people like me , I am still struggling in basic coding like loops and functions
08/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 95157 41868: I don't want the course to waste time now and go very fast or stretch 5 hours a day later point
08/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 77779 90769: So leave the thought of 1 yrs , for me the journey will be 2 yrs
08/03/22, 10:14 pm - +91 98920 05293: Go fasttrack!!👍👍
08/03/22, 10:15 pm - +91 95157 41868: Even if its goes for 2 years no problem but after few days the course should not rush.

10/03/22, 1:08 pm - +91 80831 70499: Loc understand the  name only like if you want to filter out name column you can use loc function
10/03/22, 1:09 pm - +91 6309 531 972: loc and iloc ---row selection and loc is used for variable indexing and iloc for number indexing loc['A'] and iloc[1]

10/03/22, 10:32 pm - +91 90210 64912: Javascript is like Ambani in it sector 
Python is like China
10/03/22, 10:32 pm - +91 98920 05293: How is Ambani n china comparable to each other?
10/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 80089 23330: It is easy. But tougher than python because for coding it is easy for debugging the issues it is very difficult
10/03/22, 10:33 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
10/03/22, 10:34 pm - +91 90210 64912: If u learn java u will have lot of money 
Any one can learn python it's easy to understand

10/03/22, 10:37 pm - +91 90210 64912: I want to say that java developers demand is high but supply is average 
In python supply is ultra max pro
10/03/22, 10:37 pm - +91 98920 05293: 😆😆
10/03/22, 10:38 pm - +91 96274 24678: He was asking about javascript though, not java

10/03/22, 10:39 pm - +91 90210 64912: In scripting mostly python is used
10/03/22, 10:41 pm - +91 96274 24678: Javascript is much easier, but it's application is limited to frontend.
10/03/22, 10:41 pm - +91 98920 05293: Ok... Thanks 👍👍
10/03/22, 10:48 pm - +91 96274 24678: +1

What you learn doesn't decide money, rather how much you learn. In any field the pay is directly proportional to your skill level. Money is everywhere.

10/03/22, 10:50 pm - +91 98920 05293: Definitely not in mechanical engineering....just c the number of mechanical engineers shamelessly trying to transition into DS

12/03/22, 7:58 pm - +91 98920 05293: Every ML algorithm with its own maths is one hell of a topic....
12/03/22, 8:09 pm - +91 77159 94706: I suggest you to have a look at freecodecamp YouTube channel. They have uploaded a video titled "Object orientated programming in python". I used to struggle to understand OOP as well. That video cleared a lot of my doubts
12/03/22, 8:12 pm - +91 77159 94706: Also python playlist of Corey Schafer on YouTube
12/03/22, 8:34 pm - +91 77670 76332: Bro, the best way to learn modular codong is reading codes of others
12/03/22, 8:35 pm - +91 77670 76332: Others means, those who write code in modular fashion

12/03/22, 8:58 pm - +91 93102 71488: Maths is easy although I am learning machine learning beyond mathematics this semester
12/03/22, 8:58 pm - +91 93102 71488: Ok
12/03/22, 8:59 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok.. i wish u the best
12/03/22, 9:06 pm - +91 96730 62604: if you want proper math then go for applied ai
12/03/22, 9:06 pm - +91 96730 62604: courses
12/03/22, 9:06 pm - +91 96730 62604: you will get free download link through torrent
12/03/22, 9:16 pm - +91 95456 96219: same. That oop video from freecodecamp clears lots of doubts and helps in logic building.
12/03/22, 9:22 pm - +91 97664 05439: When ML and algos will stsrt in class I have not attended class from sometime

13/03/22, 9:10 am - +91 91564 97169: What is meaning of modular coding?
13/03/22, 9:33 am - +91 95124 99758: Structured format
13/03/22, 9:36 am - +91 92050 40564: Modular coding is a design technique in which we divide projects/programs into different files according to their functionality. In a larger project, this helps us in understanding and maintaining code in a better way.

Try and except ka bhi
Or classes ka bhi 
Ise hi modular coding khte hn mitr
13/03/22, 9:41 am - +91 92050 40564: In the above assignment, I created multiple directories according to the nature of the code. This might help you and hope clear you doubt.
13/03/22, 10:02 am - +91 91564 97169: Oh okay
13/03/22, 10:03 am - +91 91564 97169: Okay
13/03/22, 10:11 am - +91 98920 05293: this starting the class at 10:15 is literally a waste of time...
13/03/22, 11:02 am - +91 88517 76922: What us being taught today?
13/03/22, 11:02 am - +91 88517 76922: Is*
13/03/22, 11:05 am - +91 95157 41868: NUMPY
13/03/22, 11:23 am - +91 96274 24678: Why?
13/03/22, 11:45 am - +91 99458 54464: Look like it's comparing the number in all the variables so it's give True so for all. When we compare with string it gives False
13/03/22, 11:45 am - +91 81055 66237: Yes
13/03/22, 11:48 am - +91 99458 54464: a = 'krish'
id(a) 
b = 'sudh'
id(b)
id(a) == id(b)
13/03/22, 11:48 am - +91 99458 54464: It gives False
13/03/22, 11:49 am - +91 95390 48916: If u compare 1st element of x and z.. ie. 100=1
then also it gives true..which is wrong
13/03/22, 11:51 am - +91 99458 54464: Yeah 😂 it gives True
13/03/22, 11:52 am - +91 99458 54464: Now again confusion 😅

15/03/22, 11:26 am - +91 85279 25157: Ya it's becoming hectic,I think we should talk to sunny regarding this,I have joined just last month,I don't know what to do
15/03/22, 11:27 am - +91 77670 76332: And more of it, we have paid money to learn in live classes...
Not for watching recordings🥲
15/03/22, 11:30 am - +91 88020 51134: Eda will be covered in live class also

15/03/22, 1:38 pm - +91 96274 24678: For whom is he even conducting EDA classes? If our fsds will have separate classes for it later
15/03/22, 2:10 pm - +91 80194 45085: Actually sunny said that sudhanshu sir took only one class of eda in last fsds batch, so he is taking now completely
15/03/22, 2:10 pm - +91 95124 99758: Anyone have Idea about ETL and Cognos
15/03/22, 2:10 pm - +91 88020 51134: ETL little bit
15/03/22, 2:10 pm - +91 96274 24678: I see. So he is conducting these classes for previous batch?

15/03/22, 2:25 pm - +91 88020 51134: It would not say its a technology

17/03/22, 7:00 pm - +91 99120 85300: You need to add your credit card to ur aws account
After that add the max monthly credit card usage limit, typically 10$

Else you would be charged charged with no upper cap, this config helps you to be charged at max 10$ if you exceed your free limits
17/03/22, 7:01 pm - +91 99120 85300: You should be able to find this info on YouTube easily

19/03/22, 8:11 pm - +91 96274 24678: I checked solution of everyone. They have only written code to fetch email, github and linkedin account. 

Fetching skills is not at all easy, and requires knowledge of NLP. Those who have submitted complete solution, have utilized a dedicated module for resume parsing called pyresparser.
19/03/22, 8:49 pm - +91 87678 71603: Do we have assignments for pandas in assignment dashboard?

20/03/22, 10:22 am - +91 92050 40564: Tkinter
20/03/22, 10:24 am - +91 96412 66982: Ho gaya aj ka Sunday bekar

20/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 95390 48916: Was tkinter classes completed during weekdays?
20/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 97723 43401: Also , he will cover the content but again that will be in fast and furious pace, hardly Making sense for some people.
20/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 95390 48916: Not for a data scientist i guess
20/03/22, 10:25 am - +91 96412 66982: Aj feature engineering krwa skta tha

20/03/22, 10:27 am - +91 92050 40564: Generally most of models embedded with web framework so u could skip.
20/03/22, 10:27 am - +91 88517 76922: It's not important but good for understanding classes and objects if you are new to coding.
20/03/22, 10:27 am - +91 92050 40564: Sunny informed same
20/03/22, 10:27 am - +91 88517 76922: I haven't seen any gui build on tkinter in production.
20/03/22, 10:32 am - +91 74508 94860: Wasted one week

20/03/22, 10:34 am - +91 98920 05293: if sudh is not available then atleast krish should teach stats so that we learn something meaningful & classes are not wasted...
20/03/22, 10:35 am - +91 91564 97169: Is GUI lecture important?
20/03/22, 10:35 am - +91 91564 97169: for data science
20/03/22, 10:36 am - +91 96582 40939: Yes
20/03/22, 10:36 am - +91 88020 51134: Class is not a waste
Under internship how will you make end application?
Some of them requires gui application
20/03/22, 10:36 am - +91 96582 40939: There are so many tricks in pandas, we can learn those
20/03/22, 10:37 am - +91 98920 05293: we need to make flask/django/streamlit apps

20/03/22, 12:01 pm - +91 99120 85300: The only issue here is the way sunny is teaching this, slow theoretical and boring way
20/03/22, 12:01 pm - +91 99120 85300: app development is always interesting, weather it be API, Web or desktop or mobile or any
20/03/22, 12:02 pm - +91 99188 26691: Absolutely it is important the only concern is the speed

22/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 98920 05293: my friend from Poland bought tech neuron yesterday... for him it is less than 100 euros.... he said this is dirt cheap price at which such quality content is provided..... he paid 7000 euros for 24 week bootcamp like our FSDS.... so for me sudh n krish will remain awesome forever...
22/03/22, 8:20 pm - +91 77670 76332: Bro, sudh is in early phase of his startup....

27/03/22, 12:08 pm - +91 74409 78960: Is one neuron really good, is it worth purchasing? If anyone has bought it, can you please share your experience?
27/03/22, 12:09 pm - +91 93549 67003: 🙋🏻‍♀️
27/03/22, 12:12 pm - +91 96274 24678: What's your reason? 

My reasons are:

1. Since everything we need for data science is already available for us, I don't think I will need anything else

2. The lectures are not recorded in neat way i.e. they take 3 hours to explain something which should take 1 hour. If I need I can find better lectures on youtube

3. Support thing is crap. They don't really help.
27/03/22, 12:14 pm - +91 77670 76332: <Media omitted>
27/03/22, 12:15 pm - +91 77670 76332: And one more reason, having lot of resources increases distraction...
27/03/22, 12:15 pm - +91 77670 76332: Less focus on 1 thing
27/03/22, 12:17 pm - +91 99817 19305: Yep, you feel like learning everything given the resources but at the end it's a big confusion
27/03/22, 12:17 pm - +91 96274 24678: 4. Considering the probability of needing any other material is very low, I don't think it's worth to invest more money. Suppose by any chance, you need to study something apart fr data-science, you can purchase tech-neuron at that time. Atleast you would be investing, because you need it.
27/03/22, 12:18 pm - +91 96274 24678: Tech-neuron makes more sense for people who have not purchased fsds
27/03/22, 12:19 pm - +91 77670 76332: Guyz, the reason why people are purchasing tech neuron more and more is bcz of FOMO 😂

27/03/22, 1:17 pm - +91 96274 24678: Please note how our purchasing decision has been made based on 'we might'. A need is created when there was now. That's how consumerism works. Making you purchase things when you don't even need them today. 

Also, I am not saying, techneuron is crap. I would say it's good as in everything is segregated at one place, but again do you really think you won't find better and free tutorials on YouTube for everything?
27/03/22, 1:17 pm - +91 82082 48990: +1..
27/03/22, 1:17 pm - +91 96274 24678: when there was none*
27/03/22, 1:18 pm - +91 95157 41868: We may or may not. I might need courses other that FSDS currently or I might need classes on AWS. It's a good investment if the ineuron goes big.
27/03/22, 1:19 pm - +91 95157 41868: And I don't need finance classes. It's our money and our choice. No need to point fingers for our expenses
27/03/22, 1:20 pm - +91 96274 24678: I get you. So basically its like an investment on a cheap stock in share market hoping it would rise.

27/03/22, 2:10 pm - +91 98920 05293: For most of us who cant visit bangalore
27/03/22, 2:12 pm - +91 95390 48916: tech neuron is not required for those people who just want to make a transition now. 

It is required for those people who wants to upskill and update themselves over time, gain in depth knowledge in specific area, to grow up in your career and be a master in it.

So, choose which one you want to be
27/03/22, 2:18 pm - +91 95390 48916: Cheap stocks are not bad. Many of the top stocks we see now were cheap. But the only thing you need to ensure is if the company is fundamentally strong or not. If yes, you will get multiples of what you invested.
27/03/22, 2:34 pm - +91 96274 24678: You made good points.
27/03/22, 2:43 pm - +91 96274 24678: This actually made me rethink. Ineuron should hire you.
27/03/22, 3:40 pm - +91 92050 40564: This is not a stock market. This is upto you how are you considering platform. Someone finding beneficial therefore they interested. Might be you are not finding value that's why you are not interested
27/03/22, 3:40 pm - +91 92050 40564: Multibagger stocks give you more benefits over times😊

28/03/22, 6:29 pm - +91 98920 05293: skype support, doubt clearing sessions have proved to b of little use... so even mentoring will b same... 👍👍

28/03/22, 6:56 pm - +91 96274 24678: It's better you bug them on skype support, response will be quicker than email. Quality of response will be same though.
28/03/22, 6:56 pm - +91 98920 05293: 😆😆👍👍 same thing i was saying few mins back...
28/03/22, 6:57 pm - +91 70210 01964: Mentor one to one starting frm?
28/03/22, 6:58 pm - +91 70210 01964: Any one knows

28/03/22, 6:59 pm - +91 80917 34526: Does skype support helps just for a small doubt?
28/03/22, 7:00 pm - +91 96274 24678: Skype support doesn't mean video call if that's what you are imagining
28/03/22, 7:01 pm - +91 96274 24678: It's for doubt clearing only. So nothing like small or big
28/03/22, 7:02 pm - +91 96274 24678: And you can ask here as well, if anyone knows they will surely help
28/03/22, 7:03 pm - +91 77670 76332: this WhatsApp support is much better that there skype support 😂
28/03/22, 7:28 pm - +91 96274 24678: Has sunny scheduled any EDA class this week?

30/03/22, 9:20 am - +91 94309 18870: basic concept, but usful one:
30/03/22, 9:20 am - +91 94309 18870: https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/fopp/Sorting/SecondarySortOrder.html
30/03/22, 9:27 am - +91 94309 18870: Write a function that sorts a list of integers by their digit length in descending order, then settles ties by sorting numbers with the same digit length in ascending order.
Examples

digit_sort([77, 23, 5, 7, 101]) ➞ [101, 23, 77, 5, 7]

digit_sort([1, 5, 9, 2, 789, 563, 444]) ➞ [444, 563, 789, 1, 2, 5, 9]

digit_sort([53219, 3772, 564, 32, 1]) ➞ [53219, 3772, 564, 32, 1]























# Approach_1:

def digit_sort_1(lst):
    
    output = sorted(lst, key = lambda i : (-len(str(i)),i))
    print(f'digit_sort({lst}) ➞ {output}')
    
digit_sort_1([77, 23, 5, 7, 101])
digit_sort_1([1, 5, 9, 2, 789, 563, 444])
digit_sort_1([53219, 3772, 564, 32, 1])



print()
# Approach_2:

def digit_sort_2(lst):
    
    output = sorted(lst, key = lambda i : (len(str(i)),-i),reverse = True)
    print(f'digit_sort({lst}) ➞ {output}')
    
digit_sort_2([77, 23, 5, 7, 101])
digit_sort_2([1, 5, 9, 2, 789, 563, 444])
digit_sort_2([53219, 3772, 564, 32, 1])

30/03/22, 11:07 pm - +91 88952 15095: There how many total students in our  fsds batch
30/03/22, 11:08 pm - +91 98920 05293: no one knows exact number... but i guess it is in thousands...
30/03/22, 11:09 pm - +91 88952 15095: Lol
30/03/22, 11:09 pm - +91 95124 99758: 1k around i think
30/03/22, 11:09 pm - +91 96274 24678: I will guess around 300
30/03/22, 11:10 pm - +91 95124 99758: Too much
30/03/22, 11:11 pm - +91 77670 76332: How?
30/03/22, 11:11 pm - +91 98920 05293: what 300?? i was promoted as panelist during doubt session n i saw 500+ members in the list.... this much after people drop off at 1 pm... i had seen at around 3pm...
30/03/22, 11:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: in live with Hitesh Krish said Sudh handles batches of more than 2000 people so i guess it must b in thousands
30/03/22, 11:13 pm - +91 79822 47474: Sudhanshu sir  was saying 35 to 40 mentor. 
Under my mentor there are 17 person and now she has told me that most of the people has not joined.
So, I think 35*30=1050 FSDS aspirations.
Assuming 30 members per mentors
30/03/22, 11:14 pm - +91 98920 05293: also many people may not have filled the form... so the total number could b even higher
30/03/22, 11:15 pm - +91 79822 47474: May be
30/03/22, 11:16 pm - +91 98920 05293: 17 is already too much... its going to become like skype support i think...
30/03/22, 11:17 pm - +91 99953 93473: Guys lifetime access is to be over this 12 :00 .
Is one neuron needed??? Just asking for your views???
30/03/22, 11:18 pm - +91 98920 05293: just buy it man.... only 7k... this is lesser than even netflix for one year... & oneneuron is for lifetime....
30/03/22, 11:18 pm - +91 77779 90769: Guys if they will start teaching like this even new concepts in night evening classes , then how we will revise spl for working professional
30/03/22, 11:19 pm - +91 88952 15095: Exactly
30/03/22, 11:24 pm - +91 79822 47474: I have just found my mentor on linkedin. 
She is going to pass-out in 2022.
She is working as an intern from ineuron.ai.
30/03/22, 11:25 pm - +91 77670 76332: 😱
30/03/22, 11:25 pm - +91 88952 15095: 🤣
30/03/22, 11:26 pm - +91 77670 76332: Yes, me too feeling lost...
Kabhi 9pm lo lecture rehta hai, kabhi 10pm...
30/03/22, 11:26 pm - +91 79822 47474: Just 1 year 2 months completed
30/03/22, 11:27 pm - +91 79822 47474: I think,  when we will enrolled in a project as a intern then it might be possible. I will be mentor for someone. 🤣
30/03/22, 11:31 pm - +91 99804 11156: Who said, they are teaching new concepts on weekdays.. new concepts are taught only on weekends.
30/03/22, 11:33 pm - +91 98920 05293: dude.. 10 pm lecture is only on tuesdays.... rest all r 9 pm..
30/03/22, 11:33 pm - +91 77670 76332: Ok
30/03/22, 11:36 pm - +91 96274 24678: Hmm, based on info provided you and Ankur. 1500 should be a safe guess for our batch. (Considering those 35-40 mentors are also taking previous batch student as mentees)  
500 from prev batch makes total =2000 which Krish was talking about
30/03/22, 11:37 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok..
30/03/22, 11:39 pm - +91 77779 90769: Plz attend today class

31/03/22, 4:23 am - +977 984-1709146: Can anyone help me with this data set to perform EDA ML model
31/03/22, 6:13 am - +91 99817 19305: a little suggestion, instead of covering everything , i think you should go by your own roadmap, fastrack or not, I dont think you should attend every class, but only selected class such as eda, statistics , ml ,data visual, pandas  and numpy and python. With this you can keep your focus in data science and can skip some parts of python dev.
31/03/22, 6:17 am - +91 99817 19305: You can also go in slow, there is no meaning of learning deep learning if you are not good in basic ml, also our ineuron scope contains mlops and many advance topics which should be done only when basics are clear, so i would suggest to take your time with it.
31/03/22, 7:11 am - +91 79822 47474: 👏

31/03/22, 5:24 pm - +91 93102 71488: My mentor just said after listening to me , 'Bro, just go  hard in your own planned way; I am damn sure you will achieve success more than a data scientist. And your success is not 100% it's beyond that , it's 1000%. 
You are running so fast, just hustle 24*7'.
31/03/22, 5:38 pm - +91 98920 05293: Good simple advice.....no planning required from mentor side...

01/04/22, 5:16 pm - +91 93102 71488: u r right.. I am just lagging in consistency.
01/04/22, 5:18 pm - +91 89509 15724: Hey guys please listen and give attention to the message sudh sir promises 5 laptops for each challenge except cloud in cloud each challenge winners have 3 macbooks
01/04/22, 5:18 pm - +91 89509 15724: But in the result they are declaring only a few candidates as winner
01/04/22, 5:19 pm - +91 89509 15724: <Media omitted>
01/04/22, 5:19 pm - +91 99808 89065: For data structures and datascience they told 5 winners each.   Not sure announced or not
01/04/22, 5:19 pm - +91 89509 15724: My name is not there in the winners also
01/04/22, 5:20 pm - +91 89509 15724: I see the sudh video
01/04/22, 5:20 pm - +91 98920 05293: they only gave prizes to people who wrote original code.... people who copied from net will get babaji ka thullu
01/04/22, 5:20 pm - +91 89509 15724: I can also send the link here
01/04/22, 5:20 pm - +91 96274 24678: Lol
01/04/22, 5:20 pm - +91 89509 15724: Are bro khid se hi likha h
01/04/22, 5:21 pm - +91 98920 05293: its not abt leaderboard standing... its abt genuine learning n writing ur own code...
01/04/22, 5:21 pm - +91 96274 24678: Sudh had mentioned leaderboard will not decide the winner, but that there would be marking based on how neat your code is
01/04/22, 5:21 pm - +91 98920 05293: Krish has mentioned this copying in his video... go watch it
01/04/22, 5:22 pm - +91 89509 15724: Pls provide link
01/04/22, 5:22 pm - +91 98920 05293: go n see on youtube man
01/04/22, 5:22 pm - +91 96274 24678: And the guys who evaluate are pro, they can tell easily which code is good.
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 89509 15724: All these things are correct but so much candidates participated in data science masters and they only anounce a two or three winners means all candidates are fake ?
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 88020 51134: Huh
Ye saab phele batana tha na
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 89509 15724: They have to announce atlwast five
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 89509 15724: Sahi batt h
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 88020 51134: Sudh sir said
5 winners btw
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 89509 15724: They are not doing good
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 89509 15724: Yes
01/04/22, 5:38 pm - +91 89509 15724: You are right
01/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 89509 15724: According to i neuron every guy is copying
01/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 89509 15724: There rules are contradictory
01/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 98920 05293: kitna bhi sarr patak lo krish kuch nahi denewaala
01/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 89509 15724: Ye krish sir ka chela lagta h 😂
01/04/22, 5:40 pm - +91 98920 05293: dude... if they have not selected u... just accept it like a gentleman... no need of shouting n laughing on others..
01/04/22, 5:40 pm - +91 88020 51134: 😂😂😂
When he teach stats in class it feels like formality 
But when its about YouTube session his teaching and behaviour changes
01/04/22, 5:40 pm - +91 89509 15724: Bro if you worked hard and you do not get the result you also do the same
01/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 89509 15724: Can you please clarity the same in data science master challenge
01/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 98920 05293: no man... he teaches genuinely.... the way he explains i have not seen any teacher explain yet...
01/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 89509 15724: I accept that in other courses all are copying but
01/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 89509 15724: Omkar pardhane is the top one in full stack leaderboard
01/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 98920 05293: sue them.... take them to court...
01/04/22, 5:42 pm - +91 89509 15724: And have scored also in the mac challenge also he doesnot get nothing
01/04/22, 5:42 pm - +91 89509 15724: <Media omitted>
01/04/22, 5:42 pm - +91 98920 05293: thats fine... people accept decisions sportingly...
01/04/22, 5:43 pm - +91 89509 15724: Are bhai 5 jano ka vada karke 3 jano ko topy doge to bache 2 to bad fell karenge
01/04/22, 5:44 pm - +91 98920 05293: bad feel karo nahi to muhalle ko aag laga do... they will only reward those who they feel r genuine... n they r damn smart people...
01/04/22, 5:44 pm - +91 96274 24678: Yeah he only said it last week. That forget about leaderboard (I am sure he said because the assignments are auto-marked) and that his team will do thorough checking
01/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 98920 05293: rather than getting agitated abt this  start preparing for the next courseathon.... maybe u will win next month
01/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 88020 51134: Actually he said leaderboard will change very fast 
Not to forget about it
01/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 89509 15724: +100000000
01/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 89509 15724: Have you participated ?
01/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 98920 05293: yes of course...
01/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 89509 15724: Which challenge?
01/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 96274 24678: Really?
01/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 98920 05293: DS of course.... its fine if i dont win.... what i learnt for this courseathon is more valuable...
01/04/22, 5:47 pm - +91 89509 15724: So are you in top 10 or what ?
01/04/22, 5:48 pm - +91 98920 05293: & especially if u r in India start accepting defeats n moving on.... our population is so huge that winning requires some serious talent in u.... always remember this... otherwise all in all.. u r just another brick in the wall...
01/04/22, 5:50 pm - +91 89509 15724: My simple base point is not to defame i neuron or so but only point is that please clarify the terms and conditions clearly before starting any coursthon they cleay said  atleat 19 winners will be selected and in ds no one can do copy like things and so much people participated in that so atleast 5 should receive the mac 
Isnt is sound convincing to you please see this meesage with no biasness then reply
01/04/22, 5:54 pm - +91 96274 24678: Maybe the number of people who enrolled in tech-neuron because of this challenge was less than what they were hoping, so they thought let's cut down the waste of money
01/04/22, 5:55 pm - +91 89509 15724: Good one
01/04/22, 5:56 pm - +91 96274 24678: But you have valid point, they should stick to their words. Is official announcement done? If not, maybe they will announce it correctly when it's time
01/04/22, 5:58 pm - +91 89509 15724: Yes that what i am talking about sir because atleast 5 honest guy should definitely present in the data science master challenge because itself in our batch so much guys are amazing

01/04/22, 8:28 pm - +91 96274 24678: Are you in this list?
01/04/22, 8:29 pm - +91 96274 24678: Most probably what you guessed earlier. People must have been making noise. He might update the winner list and release new video
01/04/22, 8:30 pm - +91 98920 05293: les hope for the best
01/04/22, 8:30 pm - +91 96274 24678: What's in it for you?

01/04/22, 8:33 pm - +91 96274 24678: I don't think koi naam kharab hoga, only a fraction of people like us has noticed.
01/04/22, 8:34 pm - +91 98920 05293: BTW do we have Sunny's class tonight?
01/04/22, 8:34 pm - +91 96274 24678: And don't underestimate the forgetting power of people

02/04/22, 5:20 pm - +91 98920 05293: sudh's example in class is too simple & his tasks are of next level difficulty...

02/04/22, 5:27 pm - +91 98920 05293: adding 2 numbers in class & interfacing separate databases in task.... worlds apart...
02/04/22, 5:30 pm - +91 95813 89147: That's the reality..after u join tasks will 100 times harder
02/04/22, 5:31 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok... i agree... he should teach that sort of difficulty in class.... not give it for self study...
02/04/22, 6:31 pm - +91 81055 66237: +1
02/04/22, 6:35 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
02/04/22, 8:35 pm - +91 94309 18870: According to me, Self study and self explore karne se ek fayda hota hai ki...jaha jaha faste hai ...wo chiz yaad ho jaati hai par...par it takes a lot of time ...for me, it takes sometimes 20x time. Jaise ki GUI waale homework k liye maine 3-4 din mehnat kiya tha..tab bhi ache se complete nahi ho paaya tha...


I have joined the program to make the transition as soon as possible....

The fast track mode makes the process a bit smoother for me...  

Lekin saare tasks ka ache se discussion hona jaruri hai... sometimes I feel frustrating 😁 jab nahi banta hai to

But on the other hand, if we will be covering each and every thing in the class, then I don't think that even 18 months would be enough for the course to be completed. They are already covering a vast area. Isliye complain bhi nahi kar sakte 🙃
02/04/22, 8:37 pm - +91 94309 18870: Air temperature waala prediction model bana raha hu ... lectures me knn svm par pahuch gaya par is task ka discussion nahi hua hai abhi tak...
02/04/22, 8:39 pm - +91 94309 18870: Aise bahut saare tasks hai 😁

02/04/22, 8:52 pm - +91 93102 71488: that's the advantage with you sir, 
i am struggling hard in my college exams
02/04/22, 9:23 pm - +91 96274 24678: We can arrange our own discussion for the discussion of task with those who are willing to
02/04/22, 9:25 pm - +91 77670 76332: Nice idea
02/04/22, 9:29 pm - +91 94309 18870: 🤟

02/04/22, 9:40 pm - +91 96274 24678: But for that there has to be atleast one person present who has completed the task 😂
02/04/22, 9:45 pm - +91 75668 30338: 😂
02/04/22, 10:20 pm - +91 93102 71488: we can discuss on that too..
02/04/22, 10:21 pm - +91 93102 71488: Just let us know few days before discussion

It's the file which sunny has shared, the flask is not working, nor the pip

Python is installed in my system, because i use jupyter and pycharm. 

But vscode is not able to run python, does anyone know how to fix it? Any video or website would help too, if you can provide

04/04/22, 12:11 pm - +91 77159 94706: They will shift our timings I guess
04/04/22, 12:11 pm - +968 7242 7252: that means Sunny will teach machine learning
04/04/22, 12:11 pm - +91 98920 05293: No i think sudh will start teaching there n for us stats with krish will start
04/04/22, 12:12 pm - +91 98920 05293: By Sunny i hope u mean Sunny Bhaveen Singh..... Not Sunny savita
04/04/22, 12:12 pm - +91 99804 11156: Is it the same course as ours ?
04/04/22, 12:12 pm - +968 7242 7252: sunny savita
04/04/22, 12:13 pm - Nitin iNeuron: But they said sudh will teach ml
04/04/22, 12:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: Sunny savita is hard working but not the best teacher for new concepts.....
04/04/22, 12:13 pm - +968 7242 7252: lets hope
04/04/22, 12:13 pm - Nitin iNeuron: +1
04/04/22, 12:13 pm - +968 7242 7252: for our age .. i watch him in 2 x
04/04/22, 12:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: Yes....he will teach ML most probably....he doesnt let anyone else teach ML
04/04/22, 12:14 pm - +91 98920 05293: 😆👍👍
04/04/22, 12:14 pm - +968 7242 7252: he cant be in two places
04/04/22, 12:14 pm - +91 97723 43401: They are making great business 😅
04/04/22, 12:15 pm - +91 98920 05293: Yes...i hope Sunny Bhaveen singh comes flr ML or Krish.... They both r awesome....
04/04/22, 12:15 pm - +91 98920 05293: Rather than working in DS...teaching DS is a better money earning...
04/04/22, 12:15 pm - +968 7242 7252: my person choice is sunny bhaveen or sudh
04/04/22, 12:16 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
04/04/22, 12:16 pm - +968 7242 7252: personal*
04/04/22, 12:16 pm - +91 98920 05293: Sudh sometimes goes very slow in first hour n too fast in next 2 hours....not a consistent pace of teaching...
04/04/22, 12:17 pm - +968 7242 7252: Sunny is awsum in that context ..but sudh covers topics in his pace
04/04/22, 12:18 pm - +91 98920 05293: On saturday he took 1 hour to explain API on whiteboard n then went full speed with coding....
04/04/22, 12:19 pm - +91 98920 05293: I hope he goes gently for python project....
04/04/22, 12:23 pm - +91 93102 71488: 🙂
04/04/22, 12:25 pm - +91 89218 66691: Maybe they have hired new people for teaching in that batch
04/04/22, 12:31 pm - +91 98920 05293: sudh will never let anyone else teach python or ML in FSDS.... thats the reason Sunny doesnt teach anything new & only takes miscellaneous topics like GUI EDA etc...
04/04/22, 12:37 pm - +91 88952 15095: This api thing is so confusing
04/04/22, 12:37 pm - +91 88952 15095: Couldn't able to import flask🤦🏻‍♂️
04/04/22, 12:45 pm - +91 93102 71488: don't worry guys
04/04/22, 12:46 pm - +91 91564 97169: No API is easy concept only things is you just clear out that.
04/04/22, 12:50 pm - +91 77159 94706: I suggest you watch some YouTube tutorials as well. They can be really helpful. Don't be completely dependent on ineuron for anything.
04/04/22, 12:56 pm - +91 96274 24678: I was thinking of doing a project where the recorded video automatically fast-forwards everytime he repeats same line. I am guessing, video time will reduce by 70-75%
04/04/22, 12:59 pm - +91 98920 05293: "Tell me guys...yes or no..." This is 30% of his time....
04/04/22, 1:01 pm - +91 96274 24678: When demand of workers in a field is on downward slope, teaching is the only option to earn good money by cashing on those who jumped in the field when it's too late (i.e when boom is passed )
04/04/22, 1:01 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
04/04/22, 1:04 pm - +91 96274 24678: He will once Ineuron becomes bigger brand and he would rather have people work for him

04/04/22, 1:58 pm - +91 99188 26691: Because in his u.g college you cannot pass engineering mathematics  easily the professor of engineering maths is very strict
04/04/22, 2:03 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
04/04/22, 2:05 pm - +91 99188 26691: Also preperation of gate exams help in algorithms understanding as engineering maths has very high weightage also the level of it is notch higher than rest in ec and cs

05/04/22, 2:47 pm - +91 88952 15095: And @919892005293 you said that Avnish yadav is the best supportive guy? I don't think so

05/04/22, 2:57 pm - +91 98920 05293: Ok...he was quite nice when he had joined last year....now he could have changed...
05/04/22, 2:57 pm - +91 88952 15095: He just gave a project without saying anything🤣
05/04/22, 3:03 pm - +91 98920 05293: What is the nature of the project he has given?

05/04/22, 6:31 pm - +91 70006 50240: See it's not necessary that if u learn DS the company will provide u the same project... In some of the casses they will provide
05/04/22, 6:31 pm - +91 96274 24678: On what skills were you hired? Surely not ML/DL or anything advanced, otherwise you wouldn't care who takes the future classes
05/04/22, 6:31 pm - +91 70006 50240: Bcz I faced it earlier
05/04/22, 6:32 pm - +91 99808 89065: In the beginning many where telling Sudhanshu that sunny is teaching well... That might be there in Sudhanshu sir's mind. So slowly he is giving to sunny?! 
Today I was going through deep learning of sunny Bhanu Chandra. It is good.
05/04/22, 6:32 pm - +91 96274 24678: Okay, but can you answer when you started preparing for Data Science transition?
05/04/22, 6:32 pm - +91 96274 24678: It's possible. 

Haven't checked Chandra yet, will check soon
05/04/22, 6:32 pm - Nitin iNeuron: I think sunny i good for theory part not for coding
05/04/22, 6:32 pm - +91 70006 50240: Sunny is teaching revision class weel bcz we know the main things so it was easy to understand thats y

05/04/22, 7:32 pm - +91 99808 89065: 🙏 hope for this ..
05/04/22, 7:33 pm - +91 96274 24678: Do companies really need Data Scientists anymore? Most companies only need analysts, and that work anyone can do using tableau/powerbi. 

I wonder if this field is saturated
05/04/22, 7:48 pm - +91 99808 89065: From my another friend who won the second prize told that prize distribution postponed to April 16. Let us see.

Can anyone suggest me if I should cover syllabus with fast pace to catch up with everyone or I should keep going with the pace I am comfortable with?
07/04/22, 11:51 am - +91 99120 85300: Fast pace should work if you are already comfortable with coding
07/04/22, 11:52 am - +91 99120 85300: Else go at your comfortable pace, most topics covered are python programming and integrations with DB, pandas, dataframes

07/04/22, 12:36 pm - +91 98920 05293: Try to attend live classes...this way u will get to engage with Sunny for any doubts....u may face problems interfacing with certain softwares like flask, mongodb etc...if u keep up with class then its better for u i think...
07/04/22, 1:08 pm - +91 80917 34526: Thanks 
I'll try to catch up
07/04/22, 1:28 pm - +91 96274 24678: Are you kidding? How many of us get to be heard? There is no engagement. Out of 500 people, if he is responding to 5, then it's not engagement. 

Live classes are same as recorded because of this absence of opportunity to ask question. 

I would rate recorded videos better, as atleast you can skip when the time is being wasted on random talk.
07/04/22, 1:29 pm - +91 97664 05439: Yaa i feel the same
07/04/22, 1:29 pm - +91 88020 51134: True
I have to spam msg to get the attention
07/04/22, 1:30 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
07/04/22, 1:31 pm - +91 98920 05293: I dont know abt ur experience... But i have always got my queries answered in doubts session...
07/04/22, 1:31 pm - +91 96274 24678: Not at all. Take your own time. Watch videos on youtube, if a lecturer is taking too long or wasting time or being unnecessarily repetitive.  

The classes happen 2 times a week or sometimes 1 time a week. 
It won't take you long if you started studying everyday. Max 2 weeks you will catch up. 
But yes, make sure you practice the assignments
07/04/22, 1:33 pm - +91 96274 24678: I never spammed maybe that's why my questions never got answered.
07/04/22, 1:33 pm - +91 88020 51134: Not spamming but put your msg with little time gaps
07/04/22, 1:35 pm - +91 96274 24678: Sometimes there are multiple doubts and I wish it was a physical class. Lol but it is what it is. Can't expect much from a cheap course.
07/04/22, 1:41 pm - +91 81230 03525: Guies any luck with mentorship , is it useful?
07/04/22, 1:42 pm - +91 81230 03525: I am yet to get a mentor
07/04/22, 1:45 pm - +91 88020 51134: Yup they are better than support team
They are taking 1-2 days to reply :)
07/04/22, 2:25 pm - +91 80831 70499: Hemraj is available is in this group or not?

U have one list ex-
L=[1,22,3,3,4,5]
So what u need to do is make  all elements repeated like output should be like 
L=[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
08/04/22, 3:41 pm - +91 90669 76933: in L is it 22 or 2,2?
08/04/22, 3:41 pm - +91 70006 50240: 2,2
08/04/22, 3:43 pm - +91 90669 76933: L=[1,2,2,3,3,4,5]
s= list(set(L))*2
s.sort()
print(s)
o/p:[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5]
08/04/22, 3:44 pm - +91 90669 76933: @917000650240 is what you are expecting?

I thought if converting elements into string and then multiplying it

08/04/22, 5:19 pm - +91 85889 95419: Hey anybody here who knows about query optimization in mongodb
08/04/22, 5:22 pm - +91 72769 03768: Got it

09/04/22, 12:25 pm - +91 80194 45085: Can someone pls tell what is utf encoding
09/04/22, 12:27 pm - +91 95157 41868: UTF-8	A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long. UTF-8 can represent any character in the Unicode standard. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for e-mail and web pages
09/04/22, 12:27 pm - +91 95157 41868: In other words, <meta charset="utf-8"> tells the browser to use the utf-8 character encoding when translating machine code into human-readable text and vice versa to be displayed in the browser
09/04/22, 12:28 pm - +91 80194 45085: Thanks
09/04/22, 12:28 pm - +91 90210 64912: U can encode txt  using it

09/04/22, 1:37 pm - +91 87678 71603: Why do we use Flask(__name__) instead of just Flask can someone please explain
09/04/22, 1:39 pm - +91 99808 89065: If you are using a single module (as in this example), you should use __name__ because depending on if it's started as application or imported as module the name will be different ( '__main__' versus the actual import name). This is needed so that Flask knows where to look for templates, static files, and so on.
09/04/22, 1:40 pm - +91 99808 89065: from google.  read last line it is imp.  __name__ holds the name of module from where it is called right?!
09/04/22, 1:42 pm - +91 98490 24355: Right
09/04/22, 1:42 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍

10/04/22, 4:10 pm - +91 98920 05293: Sudh went very fast during aws n azure deployment....i found it extremely difficult to keep up with his pace...
10/04/22, 4:11 pm - +91 99808 89065: Same here. I stuck in heroku itself.. need to practice.
10/04/22, 4:12 pm - +91 88952 15095: Recordings aa jayega
10/04/22, 4:12 pm - +91 99808 89065: Inside the project itself apart from .py file html, .css etc many things there to learn..
10/04/22, 4:12 pm - +91 98920 05293: Heroku is easiest
10/04/22, 4:13 pm - +91 99808 89065: While uploading to git some issues happened to me..
10/04/22, 4:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: Those things can b ignored... Separate team will b there for those....we need to focus only on python part
10/04/22, 4:14 pm - +91 98920 05293: Use drag n drop for github....since this is the first time
10/04/22, 4:14 pm - +91 96274 24678: That's why recordings are best. You can pause and repeat the sections of video as much as you like before moving forward
10/04/22, 4:14 pm - +91 88952 15095: Yeah exactly
10/04/22, 5:02 pm - +91 99120 85300: Aws is used more in companies, AWS is an ecosystem
10/04/22, 5:07 pm - +91 98920 05293: Yes i guess they r the market leader right now
10/04/22, 5:08 pm - +91 99120 85300: Currently yes. And AWS will be similar to GCP and AZURe etc
10/04/22, 5:08 pm - +91 98920 05293: Everyone who added credit cards just watch out guys...i just got sms from my bank that these services have automatic standing instructions for debit upto 2 lac rupees until cancelled...i just manually deleted it...
10/04/22, 5:09 pm - +91 99120 85300: AWS + ML skill can get you into MLOps job role
10/04/22, 5:09 pm - +91 98920 05293: What does mlops mean?
10/04/22, 5:10 pm - +91 90210 64912: If anyone is student here apply for GitHub student developer pack and get Azure 200 dollar credit without any card requirement
10/04/22, 5:10 pm - +91 99120 85300: In DevOps department, they are using engineer to help with ML model deployments

May be google can get you more details
10/04/22, 5:11 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
10/04/22, 5:11 pm - +91 98920 05293: Thanks for sharing...what other benefits does this give apart from azure credits?
10/04/22, 5:12 pm - +91 90210 64912: They also give many applications licence and tools there is a big list of it
10/04/22, 5:12 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
10/04/22, 5:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: Last 2 sessions....there is a lot to unpack
10/04/22, 5:34 pm - +91 80194 45085: U mean we have terminate the instances or stop??
10/04/22, 5:35 pm - +91 80194 45085: Aws right?
10/04/22, 5:43 pm - +91 98920 05293: Do both azure n aws....getting the experience of deployment is imp....
10/04/22, 5:44 pm - +91 90210 64912: Both deployment process is same just names of keys are different
10/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 98920 05293: In aws beanstalk n pipeline 2 different things need to b setup.....in azure its just one...
10/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 90210 64912: Yes
10/04/22, 6:01 pm - +91 98920 05293: how to ensure aws & azure wont generate any bills? anyone has any idea in this area?
10/04/22, 6:02 pm - +91 99188 26691: Yes please someone give insights
10/04/22, 6:02 pm - +91 92067 99757: Stop the services as soon as you are done with your activities
10/04/22, 6:03 pm - +91 98920 05293: can u pls provide any link for both platforms which can guide us?
10/04/22, 6:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: should we terminate environment in elastic beanstalk to avoid generating bills?
10/04/22, 6:15 pm - +91 92067 99757: I guess it's free of cost
https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/pricing/
10/04/22, 6:15 pm - +91 80194 45085: +1
10/04/22, 6:16 pm - +91 98920 05293: thats gr8 if true...
10/04/22, 6:17 pm - +91 92067 99757: And I guess the applications that we deploy are not going to consume a lot of resources and things should workout with free tier
10/04/22, 6:18 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok..thats comforting to know....
10/04/22, 6:20 pm - +91 80194 45085: Actually somepeple commented in YouTube videos that they forgot to terminate n got bills in lakhs
10/04/22, 6:21 pm - +91 98920 05293: yes this is what i m worried abt.... its possible those could b talking abt EC2 instances... which we r not using...
10/04/22, 6:21 pm - +91 92067 99757: Yeah as it'll be billed based on hourly basis so if you keep them up all the time then it'll be charged
10/04/22, 6:22 pm - +91 92067 99757: Free tier has certain number of free hours per month for each resource
10/04/22, 6:23 pm - +91 80194 45085: Okk
10/04/22, 6:33 pm - +91 77670 76332: 😨😨
10/04/22, 6:36 pm - +91 92050 40564: Ec2 higher configuration with load balancing billed a lot
10/04/22, 6:36 pm - +91 98920 05293: guys we dont know what is the exact number of students in FSDS but it is so high that my deployments in both aws & azure had failed in the noon... but now i could do both smoothly... even such tech giants like MS & amazon cant handle FSDS load.... 😆
10/04/22, 6:36 pm - +91 98920 05293: just like datastax astra cassandra
10/04/22, 6:37 pm - +91 98920 05293: yes👍👍
10/04/22, 6:37 pm - +91 99120 85300: Only way to limit aws bills is to setup max billable amount per month which is 10$ around I guess min
10/04/22, 6:37 pm - +91 99120 85300: You can search on YouTube for help on setup
10/04/22, 6:38 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok.. thanks for this
10/04/22, 6:39 pm - +91 77670 76332: Yes, i told in  the afternoon itself...
10/04/22, 6:39 pm - +91 77670 76332: .
10/04/22, 6:39 pm - +91 99120 85300: But resolving his local git issues took more priority
10/04/22, 6:40 pm - +91 99120 85300: Believe me there are stories of people getting bills in 50k to lacs
10/04/22, 6:41 pm - +91 98920 05293: he went very slow till git issues... then so fast like a mad man....
10/04/22, 6:41 pm - +91 99120 85300: If you expose your public aws keys, scammers or hackers might use it for crypto mining, you ending up with lakhs of bill
10/04/22, 6:42 pm - +91 99120 85300: Not to scare anyone, but yeah money is involved in AwS + credit card scenario
10/04/22, 6:43 pm - +91 98920 05293: do u know how to limit usage till $10? actually for Indians they should limit till like 100 rupees
10/04/22, 6:46 pm - +91 92050 40564: Folks ... if you enabled a lot of service then it will cost
10/04/22, 6:46 pm - +91 88952 15095: 🤣
10/04/22, 6:51 pm - +91 77670 76332: No bro, but there are videos on YouTube, its quite easy
10/04/22, 6:51 pm - +91 77670 76332: I have seen it on PluralSight AWS course a long back....
10/04/22, 6:52 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok
10/04/22, 6:53 pm - +91 77670 76332: Bhai, thousands of students are watching him in live class....

Solving issue on screen will be the most prioritised work, bcz tab baat ijjat ki hoti hai....😅😅
10/04/22, 6:54 pm - +91 96274 24678: When he shared the deployed webapp link, max 140 people opened it (as per stats in azure dashboard) , so don't think it's thousands
10/04/22, 6:55 pm - +91 99120 85300: Sadistic satisfaction
10/04/22, 6:55 pm - +91 96274 24678: Lol
10/04/22, 6:56 pm - +91 80194 45085: I think we should ask sudhanshu sir or sunny sir to show us how limit thaise bill issues right?
10/04/22, 6:56 pm - +91 98920 05293: most people like me must b struggling with their own deployment... so might not have clicked his link
10/04/22, 6:57 pm - +91 96274 24678: 50% should be a safe guess for proportion of people who could not/did not click
10/04/22, 6:58 pm - +91 98920 05293: maybe.... also we can assume more n more people will simply give up as the course progresses.... already from flask the difficulty level has gone up...
10/04/22, 7:00 pm - +91 92067 99757: https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/control-your-costs-free-tier-budgets/#
10/04/22, 7:01 pm - +91 92067 99757: Refer this for setting up the budget and notifications for usage
10/04/22, 7:06 pm - +91 98920 05293: thanks
10/04/22, 7:07 pm - +91 93902 64978: Set up Billing Alarm
10/04/22, 7:08 pm - +91 98920 05293: yes.. they should teach us alarms before teaching deployment 😀
10/04/22, 7:10 pm - +91 77670 76332: Guyz, one more thing i would like to share, keep your AWS/Azure acc passwords very tight.....
Hackers are continuously trying to  crack this accounts
10/04/22, 7:11 pm - +91 77670 76332: once they crack your passward they make it public on internet
10/04/22, 7:11 pm - +91 77670 76332: i have experienced it!
10/04/22, 7:11 pm - +91 92067 99757: 👍

10/04/22, 7:12 pm - +91 77670 76332: Though Amazon will notify u once ur account is accessed from multiple ip addresses....
but better to be on the safer side
10/04/22, 7:13 pm - +91 98920 05293: does azure & aws have MFA?
10/04/22, 7:14 pm - +91 97903 90680: yes

10/04/22, 9:25 pm - +91 80831 70499: You are not able to upload
10/04/22, 9:26 pm - +91 80831 70499: What's your problem mam
10/04/22, 9:26 pm - +91 80831 70499: I solved my problem
10/04/22, 9:26 pm - +91 80831 70499: It is easy
10/04/22, 9:27 pm - +91 99808 89065: Like this  i am also getting instead of environment name.
10/04/22, 9:28 pm - +91 80831 70499: Go directly to your file where you have extract tha file
10/04/22, 9:28 pm - +91 80831 70499: And type cmd
10/04/22, 9:28 pm - +91 80831 70499: Have you try this?
10/04/22, 9:29 pm - +91 80831 70499: <Media omitted>
10/04/22, 9:29 pm - +91 80831 70499: Like this
10/04/22, 9:31 pm - +91 96274 24678: This will open command prompt, after that?
10/04/22, 9:31 pm - +91 80831 70499: Yess
10/04/22, 9:32 pm - +91 80831 70499: Write cmd and hit enter it will directly open in command prompt
10/04/22, 9:38 pm - +91 83096 02878: So every time no need of selecting cmd
10/04/22, 9:39 pm - +91 83096 02878: After that apply and ok
10/04/22, 9:39 pm - +91 83096 02878: Then file- restart ide.
10/04/22, 9:39 pm - +91 83096 02878: I hope this will solve your problem
10/04/22, 9:45 pm - +91 99808 89065: Thank you. I will try.👍
10/04/22, 9:53 pm - +91 96274 24678: This was not a problem. Terminal (aka cmd) is opening easily in pycharm, it's just doesn't open the virtual environment which we set up, it keeps showing PS
10/04/22, 9:54 pm - +91 83096 02878: Yes by default it shows PS power shell. If we select cmd in shell path, from next time onwards it will show the "venv"
10/04/22, 9:58 pm - +91 96274 24678: I see, let me try
10/04/22, 10:04 pm - +91 98094 12077: now you are using windows powershell click on drop button near the plus button and select diff one 
.i had  the same issue
10/04/22, 10:05 pm - +91 98094 12077: hope it will work 🙂
10/04/22, 10:10 pm - +91 96274 24678: Thank you it works

Which means, there is error in some of the source links. I will troubleshoot further and let you know. 

Meanwhile you can try some other search string, instead of one you have been trying so far.
11/04/22, 4:54 pm - +91 98094 12077: like (false , -1)

16/04/22, 12:59 am - +91 89509 15724: Lenovo is for long term

16/04/22, 1:20 am - +91 77670 76332: Processor >= i5, 8gb RAM, Nvme SSD,  (if possible any good graphics card)

16/04/22, 9:27 am - +91 88517 76922: 2gb graphics won't be enough, if you're planning to use it for the long term go with at least 3060.
16/04/22, 9:27 am - +91 88517 76922: You can find asus tuf for approx 70k in these specs
16/04/22, 9:29 am - +91 88517 76922: But it's mostly on offers, and sales. Usually it would be around 80k

16/04/22, 12:55 pm - +91 98920 05293: But its good the sooner he finishes.... We can move on ML asap
16/04/22, 12:55 pm - Nitin iNeuron: I think fast track mode class is better
16/04/22, 12:58 pm - +91 90669 76933: ??
Can anyone tell
16/04/22, 12:59 pm - +91 89818 16748: If he will do same thing in ML then every body gone mad

16/04/22, 2:19 pm - +91 84488 71680: the lecture is ended
16/04/22, 2:27 pm - +91 80089 23330: Tomorrow 5 hrs means it is very difficult as it will be exhausted for us.
16/04/22, 2:51 pm - +91 80089 23330: why sample variance is divided by n-1. I gone through some blogs but didn’t understand. Can anyone know on this. If yes please explain clearly
16/04/22, 3:08 pm - +91 88517 76922: I saw krish's video explanation on it, what he said was that it was a lot of trial and error to choose the right value to subtract and the accepted value was one. 
it's also obv that n means the cardinality of the whole dataset and we can't take n here, to calculate sample variance.
16/04/22, 3:09 pm - +91 80089 23330: Ok thank u
16/04/22, 3:10 pm - +91 88517 76922: The sample should also be a good representation, of the population. Meaning mean and sd should be close to what population mean and sd is according to my intuition.
16/04/22, 3:11 pm - +91 80089 23330: Ya got it
16/04/22, 3:12 pm - +91 88517 76922: Please correct me if i am wrong here.
16/04/22, 3:24 pm - +91 80089 23330: I read this before I pinged here. Now I understood

17/04/22, 9:27 am - +91 93541 96288: Okay thanks
17/04/22, 10:03 am - +91 99808 89065: Class is about to start..

17/04/22, 10:31 am - +91 98490 24355: Why he is getting irritated
17/04/22, 10:46 am - +91 74508 94860: He is going to burst
17/04/22, 10:47 am - +91 98490 24355: 😀
17/04/22, 10:53 am - +91 91564 97169: Anyone clear me out why krish use % before matplotlib
17/04/22, 10:55 am - +91 88861 12348: It will store the output of the plots in the notebook
17/04/22, 11:05 am - +91 88952 15095: Because some are asking useless questions may be
17/04/22, 11:26 am - +91 98490 24355: Got it but it will disturb others mind also
17/04/22, 11:26 am - +91 98490 24355: Thanks
17/04/22, 11:28 am - +880 1822-342990: yeah, he's teaching at his best but I think people are not concentrating and asking same questions again and again and this is actually irritating him.
17/04/22, 11:29 am - +91 88952 15095: Exactly
17/04/22, 11:30 am - +91 74508 94860: If this is hard What will happen when calculus comes into picture
17/04/22, 11:32 am - +91 89818 16748: In this case Sudhanshu is best..he doesn't entertain such questions during live class
17/04/22, 11:33 am - +91 80089 23330: Yes I agree. Doubts should be at the end of class
17/04/22, 11:33 am - +880 1822-342990: Yeah, my point is if you can't tolerate why don't you ignore.
17/04/22, 11:34 am - +880 1822-342990: It's obvious that you'll be asked silly questions in a live session.
17/04/22, 11:34 am - +91 88020 51134: Calculus ?
Thats not in the syllabus
17/04/22, 11:35 am - +91 98490 24355: Problem is people are from different levels of knowledge they also feel difficult to understand at first glance .we cannot find fault in students also since he is not teaching for free he should have maintain patience
17/04/22, 11:35 am - +91 98490 24355: I agree krish has good knowledge
17/04/22, 11:37 am - +91 74508 94860: If you want to understand math behind dl,  boosting algo,and many ml algo, you need  calc
17/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 88020 51134: Huh?
You completed ML?
17/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 91735 93156 joined using this group's invite link
17/04/22, 11:43 am - +91 74508 94860: I have completed theoretical part of some ml algo,amd boosting algo.
17/04/22, 12:42 pm - +91 99817 19305: I dont think we will be taught calculus since here they are only teaching us on the practical side and their main concern is deployment of ml applications
17/04/22, 12:43 pm - +91 99817 19305: they would just teach, how to use ml algo and what are the functions of each parameter is
17/04/22, 1:05 pm - +91 74508 94860: But if you want to learn ,you can learn by your own its very much fascinating  how this algos works.
17/04/22, 1:06 pm - +91 99817 19305: yeah thats true, i have watched lec of andrew ng and it was an amazing experience learing maths behind comlex algorithms
17/04/22, 1:32 pm - +91 74508 94860: Statquest is also very good.

23/04/22, 11:19 am - +91 79829 62470: To reject or accept H0, you have to compare test statistic value 21.98 with z critical value 1.96
Reject H0 if ; |test statistic| > 1.96
So here you reject H0
23/04/22, 11:19 am - +91 70210 01964: Now what to do after this
23/04/22, 11:19 am - +91 90023 66654: Plz say why 0.025

23/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 98714 64474: Because it is a two tail test... So we need to divide the alpha by 2
23/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 99188 26691: you have get your test static now look for target z in table
23/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 79829 62470: Just compare your calculated value with critical value 1.96
23/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 99188 26691: which is critical value 1.96
23/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 79829 62470: No need to look in the z table
23/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 70210 01964: now first I have to see z table na for 14.58
23/04/22, 11:22 am - +91 99188 26691: no 14.58 is calculated value
23/04/22, 11:22 am - +91 79829 62470: Just compare with 1.96😂
23/04/22, 11:23 am - +91 70210 01964: Ok 
means I have to see the value of 1.96 in z table

Correct??
23/04/22, 11:23 am - +91 91564 97169: When we check z table, please clear out me
23/04/22, 11:23 am - +91 90023 66654: Thank you
23/04/22, 11:23 am - +91 79829 62470: Z table is different and critical values are different.
Z table is used to find p-vlaue or cdf value.
23/04/22, 11:24 am - +91 91564 97169: Yaar, this statistic makes me a little bit confused
23/04/22, 11:24 am - +91 70210 01964: ?
23/04/22, 11:29 am - +91 99188 26691: no need you have got critical z value
23/04/22, 11:30 am - +91 99188 26691: z table are required for p values
23/04/22, 11:32 am - +91 79829 62470: Don't be dependent on Krish for statistics guys.
I am an chegg expert for statistics from last 2 years.
Krish has some confusion about statistical methods.
Try to learn statistics from YouTube.
23/04/22, 11:33 am - +91 91564 97169: Please suggest some channels
23/04/22, 11:33 am - +91 70588 56381: Any specific channel you would like to suggest?
23/04/22, 11:33 am - +91 70588 56381: 😀 +1
23/04/22, 11:34 am - +91 79829 62470: Statistics how to...is a good channel
23/04/22, 11:35 am - +91 77670 76332: Can't find

23/04/22, 11:37 am - +91 99188 26691: The following case you can refer
23/04/22, 11:37 am - +91 99188 26691: For case 1 null hypothesis is mean = mew
23/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 99188 26691: In this case rejection region is on both sides
23/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 88861 12348: I agree.. there are wayyy simpler ways to explain Hypothesis testing
23/04/22, 11:38 am - +91 99188 26691: Case 2 mean >= mew
23/04/22, 11:39 am - +91 99188 26691: In this case rejection region is on left
23/04/22, 11:39 am - +91 99188 26691: In case 3 mean<= mew
23/04/22, 11:39 am - +91 99188 26691: In this case rejection region is on right
23/04/22, 11:39 am - +91 99188 26691: Z critical values are 1.96 and -1.96 for case 1
23/04/22, 11:40 am - +91 99188 26691: Z critical value is -1.645 for case 2
23/04/22, 11:40 am - +91 99188 26691: And Z critical Is 1.645 for case 3
23/04/22, 11:40 am - +91 79829 62470: See.....if parameters or symbols is greatar.....then right tail test.
Eg: u>=39 or u>39
If the symbol is less than....then left tail test.
Eg: u<=15 or u<30
23/04/22, 11:45 am - +91 81055 66237: Left tail or right tail can be one tailed?
23/04/22, 11:45 am - +91 88020 51134: 2.38?
23/04/22, 11:46 am - +91 99188 26691: Yes
23/04/22, 11:47 am - +91 81055 66237: If we specify a window with less than and greater than, it is two tailed right?
23/04/22, 11:48 am - +91 99188 26691: Yes but sign of alternative hypothesis decides the rejection region
23/04/22, 11:49 am - +91 79829 62470: Yes.....these are alternative hypothesis examples
23/04/22, 11:49 am - +91 79829 62470: Null hypothesis assume equality
H0: u=30
23/04/22, 11:50 am - +91 99188 26691: Also karan in the class example sir has taken if Hi <  32 then Ho =32 it is true?
23/04/22, 11:51 am - +880 1822-342990: Anyone got z-score 2.307 ?
23/04/22, 11:51 am - +880 1822-342990: and p-value 0.0178?
23/04/22, 11:51 am - +91 99188 26691: Because I have learnt that both null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis cover the whole population
23/04/22, 11:52 am - +91 79829 62470: No no...it's not necessary
23/04/22, 11:52 am - +91 99188 26691: Ok means it is ok
23/04/22, 11:53 am - +91 79829 62470: Yes ..true...
H0: u=32
H1:u<32
It is left tail test because the parameters or symbol is less than tha value in alternative hypothesis H1
23/04/22, 11:53 am - +91 81055 66237: Yes
23/04/22, 11:54 am - +91 99188 26691: Ok I was confused whether it should be Ho<=32 or Ho=32 is ok
23/04/22, 11:55 am - +91 86228 22661: Yess, I have watched krush sir YouTube, some time different places he gives different explanation
23/04/22, 11:55 am - +91 99188 26691: Sorry Ho>=32
23/04/22, 11:55 am - +91 90023 66654: Done assignment?
23/04/22, 11:55 am - +91 99188 26691: They are useless for statistics part
23/04/22, 11:56 am - +91 99188 26691: Nothing relevant related to stats
23/04/22, 11:56 am - +91 99188 26691: All about complex probability Stanford problems
23/04/22, 11:57 am - +91 79829 62470: 😂
23/04/22, 12:00 pm - +91 98490 24355: Yes he also confused sometimes I also saw this better re heck when learning
23/04/22, 12:23 pm - +91 98920 05293: Did he really throw the pen?😆
23/04/22, 12:24 pm - +91 91564 97169: No
23/04/22, 12:24 pm - +91 99188 26691: I think yes heard some sound
23/04/22, 12:24 pm - +91 91564 97169: He throws another pen.
23/04/22, 12:30 pm - +91 88861 12348: Guys, if anyone is having doubt reg one and 2 tailed tests, one thumb rule is if there is a equals in the claim, then it's a 2 tailed test. In case the claim has less than and greater than, then it's a one-tailed test. Hope this helps
23/04/22, 12:31 pm - +91 91564 97169: Lagta hai Ineuron wale bahut paisa chhap rahe hai😅
23/04/22, 12:41 pm - +91 92050 40564: I think kisi n bahut jhhapa hai

23/04/22, 1:26 pm - +91 98920 05293: His way of teaching suddenly changed at around 12:15..... The last problem was covered very quickly.... Then at the end of problem he threw the pen...
23/04/22, 1:43 pm - +91 90027 55247: The class is still going on

23/04/22, 6:33 pm - +91 74508 94860: I also agree with you
23/04/22, 6:36 pm - +91 74508 94860: There are so many important concept which he excluded like covariance,co relation, r square,adj r square, maximum likelihood, bayes theorem and many more.
23/04/22, 6:37 pm - +91 79829 62470: You are right...but if he starts teaching all statistics....many students will quit😅😂
23/04/22, 6:38 pm - +91 74508 94860: His explanation regarding p values is not that good.
23/04/22, 6:39 pm - +91 79829 62470: I need to start a youtube channel immediately for statistics 😂😂
23/04/22, 6:40 pm - +91 74508 94860: There are so many good youtube channels already exists.
23/04/22, 6:41 pm - +91 79829 62470: That's why I don't have any YouTube channel 😜
23/04/22, 6:55 pm - +91 77670 76332: U will be soon appearing in tech neuron then...🌚
23/04/22, 8:21 pm - +91 96582 40939: Hello guys
I need one favour.Guys those who have tech neuron subscription, could you please raise a demand for *Looker* reporting tool. I already asked but they responded like they can't afford it.if we as a bulk raise for it,might be they create a playlist for it
23/04/22, 8:32 pm - +880 1822-342990: These all topics will come in the EDA and I think bayes theorem will come in the naive bayes algorithm.
23/04/22, 8:36 pm - +91 80917 34526: Can anybody tell me 
Is DSA also included in this course?
23/04/22, 8:37 pm - +91 99817 19305: yes , you can see in the dashboard

23/04/22, 8:49 pm - +91 99817 19305: this channel is acutally one of the best channel for ml algorithms and statistics on youtube, lots of theory explained very clearly here.
24/04/22, 9:26 am - +91 92050 40564: what is difference normal distribution and standard normal distribution?
24/04/22, 9:26 am - +91 88020 51134: Standard one
Mean = 0
Sd = 1
24/04/22, 9:27 am - +91 96274 24678: What's today's topic?

24/04/22, 3:13 pm - +91 99120 85300: What is this used for and isn't it available on YouTube?? 

Just curious, even if they accept your request, the course might not be upto the mark or they might take time to upload like 3months plus
24/04/22, 3:14 pm - +91 96582 40939: It's a reporting tool like power bi ,tableau.new in market n emerging one after Google acquired it
24/04/22, 3:15 pm - +91 99120 85300: Cool, good to know
25/04/22, 7:56 am - +91 80917 34526: I am in college right now and the placements are going to start next sem
Should I keep going with the course or I need to prepare DSA apart from it? 
It would be very helpful if someone can guide me properly regarding placements
25/04/22, 8:11 am - +91 92050 40564: Limit your focus to clear the placement. 1) work on aptitude ND reasoning 2) basic programing, algo  and data structure
25/04/22, 8:32 am - +91 80917 34526: And what about the course?
25/04/22, 9:03 am - +91 88020 51134: Hold on the course 
DSA is very important in placements 
- on campus placement company are highly unlikely going to recruit for Data science
25/04/22, 9:07 am - +91 80917 34526: Some companies in my college recruit for Data Science 
Is DSA required for Service based companies?
25/04/22, 9:11 am - +91 92050 40564: Don't prepare for some companies. Recruitment process is same for freshers whether recruiter is service based or product base
25/04/22, 10:04 am - +91 80917 34526: So I should prepare DS Algo with this course
25/04/22, 10:33 am - +91 98920 05293: Study ds n algo....Study as much as u can...u never know which question would get asked & if not studied u wont b able to answer....
25/04/22, 10:58 am - +91 92050 40564: Yes
25/04/22, 10:59 am - +91 92050 40564: Yes.. try to solve leetcode questions
25/04/22, 11:45 am - +91 80917 34526: Any recommended course Yt channel for DSA?

25/04/22, 12:53 pm - +91 74409 78960: True 💯
25/04/22, 12:55 pm - +91 92050 40564: @918091734526 if you could learn from free material then go for those otherwise you could buy plan according to your necessity
25/04/22, 12:56 pm - +91 99817 19305: Can someone suggest some resources for aptitude in placements

30/04/22, 9:50 pm - +91 88020 51134: Assignment?
30/04/22, 10:13 pm - +91 88861 12348: No I have a general doubt
30/04/22, 10:15 pm - +91 98920 05293: Just ask ur question...if someone knows they can answer...
30/04/22, 10:19 pm - +91 88861 12348: My question is reg least squares method. If we take partial derivates on m and c and substitute each value of x and y from the dataset, we get 2 linear equations from which we get m and c values. Then where is the application of gradient descent?
30/04/22, 10:22 pm - +91 98920 05293: This is a high level question i guess rarely anyone will know the answer... Try to ask it in doubts session to Sunny...he will definitely answer u...
30/04/22, 10:22 pm - +91 98920 05293: Try to ask tomorrow
30/04/22, 10:23 pm - +91 99188 26691: It is because you donot know the exact m and c value you take approximation and try to reach optimal point
30/04/22, 10:24 pm - +91 99188 26691: <Media omitted>
30/04/22, 10:25 pm - +91 99188 26691: If you want detailed explanation sudh has explained this in 1 hr
30/04/22, 10:25 pm - +91 88020 51134: Your y = mx + c is algorithmic equation 
If you find residual and do the derivative you get 2 equations for Mnew and Cnew
Those are your initial points
By Gradient decent you are trying to find such M and C value where 
Loss is 0 so that Mnew and Cnew become almost or equal to Cold and Mold
30/04/22, 10:25 pm - +91 99188 26691: True we try to minimise loss function
30/04/22, 10:42 pm - +91 88861 12348: For those who are aware of this question,here is a sample example where the m and c values are calculated using partial derivatives of m and c
30/04/22, 10:42 pm - +91 88861 12348: https://brilliant.org/wiki/linear-regression/
30/04/22, 10:43 pm - +91 88861 12348: If u go thru the above example u will see without doing any gradient descent, simply by substituting the values of x and y from the given dataset, the m and c can be determined
30/04/22, 10:43 pm - +91 88861 12348: So where does gradient descent come into picture
30/04/22, 10:43 pm - +91 88861 12348: Hope this helps to understand the question better
30/04/22, 10:46 pm - +91 88861 12348: I went thru all his previous batch LR videos, and that's when I got this question
30/04/22, 10:47 pm - +91 88861 12348: Chandan u r right. We will get 2 linear equations with m and c as the unknowns and x and y as the knowns from the dataset. Then why don't we solve the equations as is given in the website I shared?
30/04/22, 10:50 pm - +91 79829 62470: 😂😂😂😂
At the end of the day...this all doesn't matter.
If you how to interpret the value of m and c.....it's all set for ML.
30/04/22, 10:51 pm - +91 88020 51134: In sir’s ML module 1 video
He said there are 2 approches 
Maybe thats is the case
Btw in backend inside LR module that gradient decent being used
30/04/22, 10:53 pm - +91 88861 12348: Unfortunately I have to disagree with you.. linear regression is a very hot topic amongst interviewers, so even a little chink in understanding might be fatal 😆😆😆
30/04/22, 10:53 pm - +91 79829 62470: Go on champ🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
30/04/22, 10:53 pm - +91 88861 12348: Yes that is correct. I guess this is a very rudimentary approach, so it is not used..but I have to check with Sudhanshu or Sunny
30/04/22, 10:54 pm - +91 88020 51134: What is the 2 approches 
I didn’t noted it down and cant find it again
30/04/22, 10:55 pm - +91 88861 12348: For simple LR, I guess the 2 approaches are either using the method of least squares and the second is using gradient descent
30/04/22, 10:55 pm - +91 88861 12348: For multi variable LR, I am not quite sure
30/04/22, 10:55 pm - +91 88020 51134: That derivative one wont work In case of polynomial reg
Maybe thats why
30/04/22, 10:56 pm - +91 88861 12348: It should work in theory iv tested it with 3 variables, but computationally it is hell
30/04/22, 10:56 pm - +91 88861 12348: But ur guess is as good as mine
30/04/22, 10:56 pm - +91 88020 51134: Polynomial 
Y = ax2 + bx + c
30/04/22, 10:57 pm - +91 88020 51134: Upon derivate  x^1 will still remain
30/04/22, 10:57 pm - +91 88861 12348: But u can still sub the values of x and y
30/04/22, 10:58 pm - +91 88861 12348: And get 3 equations and solve for a,b and c
30/04/22, 10:59 pm - +91 88020 51134: Confusing 
If get the answer let me know
30/04/22, 10:59 pm - +91 88861 12348: Yes definitely
30/04/22, 10:59 pm - +91 88861 12348: I'll share in the grp

Why the output is 
'ramuk'
Anybody??? 
Please help
03/05/22, 10:53 pm - +91 83096 02878: you are slicing from last element to first. First "-1" indicates last element in the string, after colon which indicated till last, in this case from last to first. and last "-1" indicates stepping. you are decrementing one element from last.
03/05/22, 10:54 pm - +91 83096 02878: instead of that, you can use a[::-1] to reverse the string. It will also gives you same output

07/05/22, 12:22 pm - +91 91564 97169: Is Sunny's revision class effective?
07/05/22, 12:22 pm - +91 98920 05293: Can anyone tell what was the content of last Wednesday's session? Only doubts or some revision was also covered?
07/05/22, 12:24 pm - +91 98920 05293: His teaching is not as good as krish or sudh.... But he prepares good materials for reference....
07/05/22, 12:27 pm - +91 93541 96288: He gave little bit briefing about regex and then he took doubts
07/05/22, 12:27 pm - +91 91564 97169: Okay
07/05/22, 12:27 pm - +91 98920 05293: Ok thanks

08/05/22, 8:33 am - +91 92067 99757: Do we have class today?
08/05/22, 8:33 am - +91 80089 23330: Yes
08/05/22, 8:34 am - +91 92067 99757: Okay 👍
08/05/22, 10:12 am - +91 91564 97169: Is class started?
08/05/22, 10:12 am - +91 88952 15095: Yeah
08/05/22, 10:25 am - +91 90780 29962: Is feature engineering  completed??
08/05/22, 10:26 am - +91 90210 64912: No just started
08/05/22, 10:27 am - +91 90780 29962: Okk

08/05/22, 11:18 am - +91 80831 70499: Mujhe thora bht samjh aaya yrrr
08/05/22, 11:19 am - +91 88020 51134: That slope 0 of gradient decent is different from slope of line right?
08/05/22, 11:20 am - +91 91564 97169: Mujhe to 90% bouncer gaya 😅
08/05/22, 11:20 am - +91 80831 70499: I understand only 30 to40% bss smjh aaya
08/05/22, 11:21 am - +91 96582 40939: I don't understand entire Krish session
08/05/22, 11:22 am - +91 80831 70499: So how you learn statistics
08/05/22, 11:22 am - +91 80831 70499: From YouTube
08/05/22, 11:22 am - +91 96582 40939: Yes
08/05/22, 11:22 am - +91 99188 26691: Yes the slope of line refers to the coefficient whereas slope in gradient descent refers to learning rate
08/05/22, 11:22 am - +91 80831 70499: Suggest any best YouTube channel
08/05/22, 11:23 am - +91 80831 70499: @919658240939
08/05/22, 11:23 am - +91 88020 51134: Thanks for clarification
08/05/22, 11:23 am - +91 99188 26691: Welcome
08/05/22, 11:24 am - +91 91564 97169: Then bhai please suggest that youtube channels
08/05/22, 11:25 am - +968 7242 7252: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L39rN6gz7Y&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF&index=43&ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer
08/05/22, 11:25 am - +91 88020 51134: So when gradient slope become 0
Then how we get the best fitted line from that?
08/05/22, 11:26 am - +91 96582 40939: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BVsziIRdfv4Hl4UIqDZhXWV
08/05/22, 11:29 am - +91 99188 26691: The fundamental behind this phenomena is convex optimization whenever our problem has convergance property wherever we start we will reach the optimal point in the explained case when you are at region on the side where slope is positive the learning rate will push you forward otherwise backward
08/05/22, 11:29 am - +91 74508 94860: Watch this lecture you will understand very intuitively
08/05/22, 11:29 am - +91 99188 26691: At the optimal point you will not move forward or backward that's why slope is zero
08/05/22, 11:31 am - +91 88020 51134: I get this
But our aim is to find best fitted line
So how will we get M and C value?
08/05/22, 11:32 am - +91 81498 25749: But I don't think learning rate is slope of gradient decent ....learning rate is a hyper parameter...which is found by multiple experiments
08/05/22, 11:33 am - +91 99188 26691: I am talking about imaginary slope that krish has mentioned for explaining in simple way
08/05/22, 11:39 am - +91 99188 26691: By differentiating na checkout derivation of linear regression
08/05/22, 11:41 am - +91 99188 26691: <Media omitted>
08/05/22, 11:42 am - +91 88020 51134: Okay
08/05/22, 11:43 am - +91 99188 26691: Residuals here are the error terms
08/05/22, 11:43 am - +91 88517 76922: You'll rarely find slope 0 in complex problems, as in the end it just oscillates back and forth.
08/05/22, 11:44 am - +91 99188 26691: True that's why the value of learning rate is selected by hyperparameter tuning
08/05/22, 11:44 am - +91 88517 76922: Cross validation is the answer to everything 😂😂
08/05/22, 11:45 am - +91 99188 26691: Yes but krish starts it with it will be Johnson thunderbolts on WACA pitch
08/05/22, 12:27 pm - +91 74508 94860: Hey guys  how do you all rate  today's class
08/05/22, 12:30 pm - +91 89997 24124: 4 out of 10
08/05/22, 12:33 pm - +91 98920 05293: if u guys r rating today's session low... just watch Sudh's session from previous batch... u will definitely appreciate Krish....
08/05/22, 12:35 pm - +91 90669 76933: is ML started today?
08/05/22, 12:35 pm - +91 98714 64474: u guyzzz are rating low may be because u guyzz haven't seen linear regression before
08/05/22, 12:38 pm - +91 88020 51134: Sudh sir taught LR better
According to me
08/05/22, 12:39 pm - +91 81498 25749: True
08/05/22, 12:39 pm - +91 98920 05293: ok... i found his teaching extremely math oriented & not explained in simple terms....
08/05/22, 12:43 pm - +91 98920 05293: it is good that new batch has started... sudh is busy there & we get Krish for ML....
08/05/22, 12:48 pm - +91 75659 77166: Anyone started doing projects?
08/05/22, 12:49 pm - +91 75659 77166: If yes please let me know I can I get python based projects
08/05/22, 1:03 pm - +91 86228 22661: Yess..same for me... Sudhanshu sir explained gradient descent indepth and simply
08/05/22, 2:34 pm - +91 79786 21381: One who is a very beginner in machine learning will find some difficulty to understand Krish's video so for them Sudhanshu's session is good to watch
08/05/22, 2:39 pm - +91 75659 77166: Where can we find his video?
08/05/22, 2:40 pm - +91 79786 21381: You can check  previous batch's machine learning section
08/05/22, 3:40 pm - +91 98920 05293: 
08/05/22, 6:56 pm - +91 88517 76922: He's the father of GAN. Didn't know he worked for apple
08/05/22, 6:56 pm - +91 88517 76922: I am betting tesla will hire him 😂😂
08/05/22, 6:56 pm - +91 98920 05293: 👍👍
08/05/22, 6:56 pm - +91 98920 05293: Or google? Or maybe ineuron 😜😝😛
